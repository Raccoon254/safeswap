# Automatic Token Transfers with Smart Contract

## How It Works Now

Your escrow platform now uses the **deployed smart contract** for automatic, trustless token transfers!

## The Flow

### Step 1: Creator Creates Escrow (Deposits Tokens)

**What Happens:**
```
1. User fills escrow form
2. Clicks "Create Secure Escrow"
3. Frontend calls smart contract: escrow.createEscrow()
4. User approves transaction in wallet
5. ‚úÖ Tokens LOCKED in smart contract
6. Transaction confirmed on blockchain
7. Database updated with contract escrow ID
```

**Code Flow:**
- Frontend ‚Üí `createEscrow()` hook
- Hook ‚Üí Smart Contract `createEscrow(recipient, token, amount)`
- Contract ‚Üí Transfers tokens from creator to contract
- Contract ‚Üí Emits `EscrowCreated` event with escrow ID
- Frontend ‚Üí Saves escrow ID to database

**Result:** Tokens are now **held by the smart contract**, not by creator!

### Step 2: Recipient Registers & Links Wallet

**What Happens:**
```
1. Recipient clicks email link
2. Registers/logs in
3. Connects wallet (auto-fills address)
4. Wallet address saved to database
```

### Step 3: Creator Confirms

**What Happens:**
```
1. Creator clicks "Confirm Trade"
2. Frontend calls: confirmEscrow(contractEscrowId)
3. User approves transaction
4. ‚úÖ Contract marks creator as confirmed
5. Transaction confirmed on blockchain
6. Database updated
```

**Smart Contract State:**
```
creatorConfirmed: true
recipientConfirmed: false
status: ACTIVE
```

### Step 4: Recipient Confirms (AUTO RELEASE!)

**What Happens:**
```
1. Recipient clicks "Confirm Trade"
2. Frontend calls: confirmEscrow(contractEscrowId)
3. User approves transaction
4. ‚úÖ Contract marks recipient as confirmed
5. üéØ CONTRACT AUTOMATICALLY:
   - Calculates fee (1% = 0.01 LINK if 1 LINK)
   - Transfers 0.99 LINK to recipient
   - Transfers 0.01 LINK to contract owner (you!)
   - Marks escrow as COMPLETED
6. Transaction confirmed
7. ‚úÖ RECIPIENT HAS TOKENS IN THEIR WALLET!
```

**Smart Contract Code (happens automatically):**
```solidity
function confirmEscrow(uint256 _escrowId) {
    // Mark as confirmed
    escrow.recipientConfirmed = true

    // If BOTH confirmed
    if (creatorConfirmed && recipientConfirmed) {
        // Calculate 1% fee
        fee = amount * 100 / 10000
        amountAfterFee = amount - fee

        // AUTOMATICALLY transfer tokens!
        token.transfer(recipient, amountAfterFee)  // 99% to recipient
        // Fee stays in contract for owner to withdraw

        escrow.status = COMPLETED
        emit EscrowCompleted(...)
    }
}
```

## Key Differences from Manual Transfer

### ‚ùå OLD WAY (Manual - What you had):
```
1. Creator creates ‚Üí Saved to database
2. Both confirm ‚Üí Nothing happens on blockchain
3. Creator must manually send tokens via MetaMask
4. ‚ùå Requires trust - creator could refuse to send
```

### ‚úÖ NEW WAY (Automatic - What you have now):
```
1. Creator creates ‚Üí Tokens LOCKED in contract
2. Both confirm ‚Üí Tokens AUTOMATICALLY released
3. ‚úÖ Trustless - smart contract enforces transfer
4. ‚úÖ Instant - happens in same transaction as confirm
```

## Security Features

1. **Tokens Locked**: Once creator creates escrow, tokens are in the contract
2. **Can't Be Stolen**: Only the smart contract can move the tokens
3. **Automatic Release**: No human intervention needed
4. **Cancellation Protected**: Creator can only cancel before recipient confirms
5. **Fee Protection**: 1% fee automatically deducted and held for platform

## What You Need to Implement

I've already created the hooks and updated the contract ABI. Now you need to:

### 1. Update Create Escrow Page

Add blockchain transaction:
```javascript
// In create-escrow/page.js - handleSubmit()
const { createEscrow } = useEscrow()

// Call smart contract
const { hash } = await createEscrow(
  formData.tokenAddress,
  formData.amount,
  recipientWalletAddress, // Need recipient's wallet!
  decimals
)

// Wait for confirmation
await waitForTransaction(hash)

// Save to database
await fetch('/api/escrows', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    ...formData,
    transactionHash: hash,
    contractEscrowId: escrowIdFromEvent // Extract from event
  })
})
```

### 2. Update Confirm Page

Add blockchain transaction:
```javascript
// In escrow/[id]/page.js - handleConfirm()
const { confirmEscrow } = useEscrow()

// Call smart contract
const { hash } = await confirmEscrow(escrow.contractEscrowId)

// Wait for confirmation
await waitForTransaction(hash)

// Update database
await fetch(`/api/escrows/${id}/confirm`, {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ transactionHash: hash })
})
```

## The Problem: Need Recipient Wallet Early

**Issue**: Smart contract needs recipient's wallet address when creating escrow, but we only have their email!

**Solutions**:

### Option A: Two-Step Creation (Recommended)
```
1. Creator fills form with recipient EMAIL
2. Save to database as "DRAFT"
3. Send email to recipient
4. Recipient registers & provides wallet
5. Creator returns and clicks "Finalize Escrow"
6. NOW call smart contract with recipient's wallet
7. Tokens locked in contract
```

### Option B: Creator Enters Recipient Wallet
```
1. Creator must know recipient's wallet address upfront
2. Creator enters it in form
3. Immediately call smart contract
4. Tokens locked
5. Recipient just needs to confirm later
```

### Option C: Use Placeholder, Update Later
```
1. Use a temporary "holding" address
2. When recipient provides wallet, migrate escrow
3. (Complex, not recommended)
```

## Recommended Implementation: Option B

**Why?** Simpler and works immediately!

**Changes Needed:**
1. Add "Recipient Wallet Address" field to create form
2. Creator must get recipient's address beforehand
3. Create escrow immediately calls smart contract
4. Everything else works automatically!

## Summary

Once integrated, your platform will have:

‚úÖ **Automatic transfers** - No manual sending needed
‚úÖ **Trustless** - Smart contract enforces all rules
‚úÖ **Instant** - Tokens released immediately when both confirm
‚úÖ **Secure** - Tokens locked safely in contract
‚úÖ **Fee Collection** - 1% automatically collected for you

The smart contract is DEPLOYED and READY. Just need to connect the frontend!
